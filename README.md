# CAGES
Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search for Efficient Local
Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization

Our code implementation extends the [GIBO's codebase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11899) and [LVGP's codebase](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07504). More detail can be found in their repository ([GIBO](https://github.com/sarmueller/gibo/tree/main))([LVGP-python implementation](https://github.com/balaranjan/LVGP/tree/main))([LVGP-matlab implementation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2019.1638834)).

# Usage
Vanilla BO
------------------------------
Run the following command to execute vanilla BO with expected imrpovement. User can specify which problem (Rosenbrock, OTL, or Cartpole) to be optimized in line 31-33.

Two numpy files (EI_cost.np/EI_reward.np) will be saved in user's local directory including the accumulated cost and best found value per iteration.
```sh
python Vanilla_BO.py
```

GIBO and ARS
------------------------------
Run this following command to execute GIBO or ARS algorithm. User can specify which problem (Rosenbrock, OTL, or Cartpole) to be optimized in line 37-39 and specify GIBO or ARS in line 41.

Two numpy files (GIBO_cost.np/GIBO_reward.np) will be saved in user's local directory including the accumulated cost and best found value per iteration.
```sh
cd GIBO
python local_GIBO_exe.py
```

CAGES
------------------------------
Run the following command to execute CAGES for the multi-information Rosenbrock test problem.

Two numpy files (Rosenbrock_cost_CAGES.np/Rosenbrock_reward_CAGES.np) will be saved in user's local directory including the accumulated cost and best found value per iteration.

```sh
python lvgp_optimization_new_Rosenbrock.py
```

Run the following command to execute CAGES for the multi-information OTL test problem.

Two numpy files (OTL_cost_CAGES.np/OTL_reward_CAGES.np) will be saved in user's local directory including the accumulated cost and best found value per iteration.

```sh
python lvgp_optimization_new_OTL.py
```

Run the following command to execute CAGES for the multi-information Cartpole RL control problem.

Two numpy files (Cartpole_cost_CAGES.np/Cartpole_reward_CAGES.np) will be saved in user's local directory including the accumulated cost and best found value per iteration.

```sh
python lvgp_optimization_new_RL.py
```

Plotting
------------------------------
Please run the following command to load saved numpy files and generate plots. User may need to modify the path to load the file.
```sh
cd Plotting
python Plotting.py
```
Here is an example plot for the Rosenbrock problem that user can reproduce based on the np files under ~\Results\Rosenbrock:
