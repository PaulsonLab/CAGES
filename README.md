# CAGES
Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search for Efficient Local
Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization

Our code implementation extends the [GIBO's codebase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11899) and [LVGP's codebase](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07504). More detail can be found in their repository ([GIBO](https://github.com/sarmueller/gibo/tree/main))([LVGP-python implementation](https://github.com/balaranjan/LVGP/tree/main))([LVGP-matlab implementation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2019.1638834).
